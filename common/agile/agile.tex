Before agile development, project management relied heavily on the waterfall method \cite{sommerville}. 
Waterfall entails planning everything before proceeding with development in stages. 
Every stage is completed entirely before the next begins. 
The problem with waterfall is that it has no mechanism for handling uncertainty \cite{sommerville}. 
If the requirements change during development, the waterfall method cannot account for that. 

Agile development practices arose from a need for a development method that would solve the issues posed by waterfall. 
Most importantly, it would lessen the cost of making changes to the specification late in the development process \cite{alancline}. 
The Agile Manifesto from 2001 outlines the values that agile development practises are supposed to support \cite{beck2001agile}. 
The first statement of the manifesto is: "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools"\cite{beck2001agile}. 

This statement concisely encompasses the change of focus from planning and strict application of well defined procedures. 
Instead the focus should be on delivering software that the user wants.
