\section{Collaboration}\label{sec:cooperation}
\textit{The following section and its subsections are written in collaboration with other ECDAR project groups.}\vspace{1em}

\noindent This semester project specifically focuses on multi-project collaboration, which means that several project groups will be cooperating on the same project. 
Each project group functions as a scrum team. 
In total, six project groups consisting of six members each will be collaborating to further extend ECDAR. 
Five of these groups will be focusing on further development of the Reveaal engine, while the last group will focus on development of the graphical user interface of ECDAR.
