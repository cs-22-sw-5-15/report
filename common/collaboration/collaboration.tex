\section{Collaboration}\label{sec:cooperation}
\commondisclaimer

\noindent This semester project specifically focuses on multi-project collaboration, which means that several project groups will be cooperating on the same project. 
Each project group functions as a Scrum team. 
In total, six project groups consisting of six members each will be collaborating to extend ECDAR further. 
Five of these groups will focus on further development of the Reveaal engine, while the last group will focus on developing the graphical user interface of ECDAR.
