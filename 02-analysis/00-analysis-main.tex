\chapter{Sprints}
This chapter outlines how we implemented the feature. Each section outlines a sprint where each will cover the sprint plans, along with the sprint review and retrospective. Beyond these sections each sprint will have some unique sections outlining elements related to that sprint only.

In the planning phase we look ahead and will try to determine how much work can be done in this sprint, along with trying to define the tasks in the backlog better.

In the reviewing phase we look back at our product and the plans for this sprint, which we review.

In the retrospective phase we look back at the developing process and reflect on the process.
