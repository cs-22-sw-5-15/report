\subsection{Codebase}
In the codebase for the Reveaal engine, where the solution for this project has to be implemented, we are going to work around the components. More specifically, before a component is assigned its clocks, an analysis of the component should be performed. 

There are however a question arising when the analysis happens before components are combined. How to know if a clock will become redundant before components are combined? The analysis has to take into account that components
