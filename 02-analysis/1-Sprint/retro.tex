\subsection{Retrospective}
This was the first sprint of this project, and generally caused some confusion. We were not completely aware when the sprint had actually started, meaning the start was a little hectic and poorly planned. Beyond that, a good deal of sickness haunted the group, meaning we were rarely present at the same time, making it hard to work together and agree on workload and -tasks.

Generally, we found some points to improve upon for next sprint:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Clearer communication regarding project status and work
    \item Better planing and definition tasks - Better usage of project boards
    \item Stick better to the sprint plan
\end{itemize}
These points will be considered heavily for the next sprint.

One element from our process which worked good was our daily sprint meetings, where we were all caught up on what we were doing. This fell a bit short though because of the reasons above.





%Der har været få fremmødte.
%Opgaver var lidt uklare, men det var også research opgaver.

%Det var uklart at sprintet var igang. Vi skal være tydelige i, at vi holder os til sprint planning.

%Det er godt at holde daily scrum/ sock check.

%Vi håndterede diskussion om arbejdstider ved at holde et møde. Vi aftalte at torsdag er arbejdsdag. Andet fravær skal du selv finde ud af at gøre op for. Vi skal arbejde lidt udenfor 'arbejdstiden'. Dette vil være velafgrænsede opgaver.

%arbejdsopgaver skal være mere veldefinerede. Vi vil, næste sprint, bruge project board og evaluere til næste sprint review.
