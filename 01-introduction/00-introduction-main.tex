This project report details the implementation of clock reduction in ECDAR. The first section will introduce ECDAR as a model checking engine and explain the major concepts that are relevant to the project. The second section will present scrum as the framework used for collaboration. The third section will introduce the ECDAR-SW5 organization and explain how six project groups were able to collaborate on the same project. Finally, the third section contains a glossary with all of the terminology that we use throughout the report.
