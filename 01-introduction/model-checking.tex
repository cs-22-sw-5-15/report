\section{Model Checking}\label{sec:model-checking}

Systems nowadays are big and complex and consists of multiple components designed by independent teams \cite{ecdartheory}. Model checking is a method used in the software industry for years as a form of computer aided verification where logic is used for bug finding \cite{modelchecking_handbook}. A model checker takes a description of a system, known as a model, and a system specification. The model checker compares the model to the specification to check if it is satisfied by the model. If the model violates rules of the specification, the model checker produces a counter example that proves the model is indeed in violation of the specification  \cite{modelchecking_handbook}.
