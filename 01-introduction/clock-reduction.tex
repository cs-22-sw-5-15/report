\subsection{Introduction to Clock Reduction}
When removing clocks from the TIOA, it is important to make sure that the clock is never checked or it is redundant. In Reveaal most of the time is spent on DBM operations. These operations are quadratic in the number of clocks, so removing clocks would decrease the size of the DBM and the number of operations.
